# FindEQ

The purpose of this code is to efficiently find and optimize over all equilbria or fixed points of a given discrete-valued system on a graph. It implements the approach described in the paper "Computing and Optimizing Over All Fixed-Points of Discrete Systems on Large Networks" (currently under review).
